# The Black Fig

This React App, created with Next.js and Tailwind, is a fully responsive web page for a fictional restaurant. I created it from scratch, using my own design created on Figma without a template.

If not live at the moment, the app can be run locally using

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
