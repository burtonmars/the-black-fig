# The Black Fig

This NextJS app is a fully responsive web page for a fictional restaurant. I created it from scratch, using my own design created on Figma without a template. My main motive for creating this was to dip my toe into Next and get a feel for the folder structure and routing. I also enjoy trying my hand at UI design in my free time to help satiate the artsy side of my brain.

A highlight of this project is a location widget on the contact page the incorporates google maps using maps javascript API.

The app should be live at https://the-black-fig.vercel.app/

If not live at the moment, the app can be run locally using

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
